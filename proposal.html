    <h2>How can we better adopt healthy diets to supplement our lifestyles?</h2>

        <h3>Explaining the Domain Space</h3>
        <p>
            The definition of a physically healthy lifestyle comes in two forms: diet and exercise. With both fields being heavily populated in the market with brands such as FitBit and My Diet Coach, technology has found a way to improve how we make our lives better. Specifically, I want to focus on diet and eating since many apps already have to track heart rate and calories burned that are already strong solutions to exercising. I believe that tackling diet is especially important at a time where we have to limit our exercise outside, so most work in healthy living comes from eating. In regards to the problem space for information technology, it is especially hard to keep track of so many variables such as fats, carbohydrates, omega-3’s, and more. Therefore, we need to use information technology to keep track of our information and develop conclusions on diets. In my research, most diet apps such as My Diet Coach records mostly calories that are taken in, but I found a problem in the space that does not focus more on overall diets with fruits, vegetables, and lean meats. I found that the app was definitely good for losing weight, but I want to create a web app that promotes more longevity with eating diets.

        <h3>App Description</h3>
        <p>
            I specifically want to target young adults as it is more approachable for younger adults to use the website. Although young adults are not heavily affected by a poor diet, imposing healthy eating habits will save people when they are older to be accustomed to eating healthy. The information I will be using takes in user data, and I plan to add extra data to be more easily added into the system (rather than just typing them down).

        <p>
            Primarily, the use of the website is to create a way to judge how well a person eats, and the website will take that data and show healthiness over time. I’m going to have a section to input information based on the food by typing them down, but I also want to have a feature to add on the side to add popular foods such as toast. My app plans to solve the problem of diets by adding more features to better understand total eating habits, from sodium intake to Vitamin B’s. Each are important to understand as a whole.
